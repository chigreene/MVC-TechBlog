# MVC-Tech Blog

## Description

The application is Blog website built from the ground up for a blogger to be able to have a place to post blogs and get receive comments on his blog. The site has a dashboard that allows users to update or delete their reviews.

- My motivation when building this blog was to create a blog website for my self building of the projects I have created for my self.

- I built this project because I want to get into blogging but wanted to have a personalized site to post my blogs.

- The blog solves the problem of not having my own self created website to use as a blog website. I no longer have to rely on the layouts of other websites to blog since I can create what ever lay out I wish since I built this website

- What I learned is how to use the model view controller paradigm to create a website front end and back end. I also learned about sessions and authentication, and handlebars.
